#Finger exercise:  Write a program that examines three variables—x, y, and z— and prints the largest odd number among them.  
#If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

if x%2 !== 0 and x > y and x > z:
  print(x)
elif y%2 !== 0 and y > x and y > z:
  print(y)
elif z%2 !== 0 and z > x and z > y:   
  print(z)
else:
  print("Everything is even")
