#Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints two 
#integers, root and pwr, such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal to the 
#integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should 
#print a message to that effect.

#a simple guess and check algo, a nested for loop

number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

for root in range(number): #a root is every number between 0 and the number)
    for pwr in range(1,6): #a for loop for every power which is between 0 and 6
        if root**pwr == number: #if it is equal to number, it will print out the results
            print("The root is " + str(root) +" and the power is " + str(pwr))
    
#currently doesn't work with negatives and doesn't print out a message. will revisit
