#Finger exercise:  Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, 
#and then prints the largest odd number that was entered.  
#If no odd number was entered, it should print a message to that effect. 

largest = 0 #need to figure out how to initialize largest to a variable that will allow me to calculate negatives numbers

for x in range(10):
    number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    if abs(number%2) == 1 and number > largest: #abs is for negative numbers but couldn't get the program to calculate it when initalized to 0
        largest = number

if largest == 0: #largest needs to initialized to something else. this is a placeholder until I learn more. This program will work on all positive numbers.
    print ("No odd number was entered")
else:
    print("The largest odd number entered is " + str(largest))
